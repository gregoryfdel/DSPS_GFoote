Problem on MCMC and estimation of uncertainties


Problem 1 in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf). You cannot choose: Gaussian, Poisson, or Binomial. Any other distribution is fine. Make sure that your chosen disrtibution has defined mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis! (e.g. of a distribution with non defined is the Cauchy distribution, which is my favorite. Ask me why if you are curious!)
